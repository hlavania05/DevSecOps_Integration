# Security Policy  

## 1. Overview  
This document defines the security practices followed in the DevSecOps Integration project. It provides guidelines on secure coding, vulnerability scanning, and compliance measures to ensure a robust security posture.  

## 2. Security Objectives  
- Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of application data.  
- Proactively identify and mitigate security risks.  

## 3. Secure Development Practices  
- **Code Security**  
  - Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.  
  - Use parameterized queries and input validation to prevent SQL Injection.  

- **Secret Management**  
  - **GitLeaks** is integrated as a pre-commit hook to scan for hardcoded secrets.  
  - Never commit credentials, API keys, or sensitive configurations to the repository.  
  - Use environment variables and secure vaults for sensitive information.  

- **Code Review & Secure Coding Enforcement**  
  - Peer reviews must include security checks.  
  - Static code analysis tools (SonarQube) enforce secure coding standards.  
  - Quality gates are enabled to block high-risk vulnerabilities.  

## 4. Continuous Integration (CI) Security  
- **Jenkins CI Pipeline**  
  - Automatically triggers builds and security scans upon code commits.  
  - Ensures security compliance before merging changes into the main branch.  

- **Static Code Analysis**  
  - **SonarQube** scans the codebase to detect security vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells.  
  - **Snyk** identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies and third-party libraries.  
  - Code that does not meet security quality gates is rejected.  

## 5. Continuous Testing (CT) and Security Assessments  
- **Staging Security Testing**  
  - A staging environment mirrors production to test security controls before deployment.  
  - API endpoints are tested using **Postman** for reliability and security.  

- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**  
  - **OWASP ZAP** is used to simulate attacks and identify runtime vulnerabilities.  
  - Automated scans detect security misconfigurations and unauthorized access risks.  

## 6. Continuous Security Feedback  
- **Infrastructure Security Audits**  
  - **Nessus** performs weekly vulnerability scans to detect security flaws in infrastructure.  
  - Regular patching and system updates are enforced based on Nessus reports.  

- **Policy Updates & Incident Response**  
  - Security guidelines are reviewed and updated periodically.  
  - Developers are notified of security patches and required updates.  
  - In case of a security breach, report it immediately to the security team.  

## 7. Reporting Security Issues  
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it immediately via **abc@gmail.com**. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will take necessary actions promptly.
